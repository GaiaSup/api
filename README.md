This directory contains all the API language bindings for GaiaSup.
To ease the development of using GaiaSup, these language bindings
provide language-specific ways to access and use the REST API provided
by GaiaSup.

As there can be many different language bindings available, we offer 
both official bindings (provided by the GaiaSup team) and also community 
bindings which are made available by community members.

All official language bindings are offered under the MIT License
(please see LICENSE file), and community bindings are offered under
licenses chosen by the respective developers. 

Currently, the following bindings are official:

Please note that the language bindings are not part of the services
offered by GaiaSup, and we do not guarantee its performance or stability.
